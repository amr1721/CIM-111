          <h3>Edilia Puig</h3>
          <p>Born and raised in Cuban, Edilia Puig learned how to cook tradition Cuban Cuisine like most woman did on the island. When the time came for her family to escape their homeland, my grandmother tried to make the trasition as smooth as possible for her little children.
            <br>
            <br>
           To try to keep some sense of normalcy in their lives, and because it was all she knew, my grandmother cook her favorite recipes from growing up as often as she could. Not only did she share her meals and recipes with the rest of her community, but she also passed them down to my mother, who has since passed tham down to me. Food and having meals together hold a special power and magic that keeps families and memories together in a strong bond, a bond that goes beyond time and distance. <br>
           <br>
            And now I share some of her favorite recipes with you, the way she taught me.</p>
