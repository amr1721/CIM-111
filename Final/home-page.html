                  <h4>Ingredients</h4>
                  <p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>1 1/2 pounds flank steak, cut into 4 pieces</li>
                      <li>1 green bell pepper, cored and quartered</li>
                      <li>2 large onions — 1 halved, 1 thinly sliced</li>
                      <li>1 bay leaf 2 garlic cloves, smashe</li>
                      <li>Salt</li>
                      <li>1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice</li>
                      <li>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                      <li>Freshly ground pepper</li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>
                <h4>How to Make It</h4>
                <p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>In a large saucepan, combine the flank steak with the bell pepper, halved onion and bay leaf. Add enough water to cover and bring to a boil. Simmer over moderate heat for 20 minutes. Transfer the flank steak to a work surface and let the steak cool. Strain the broth and reserve for another use. Shred the meat and transfer it to a bowl.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Using the side of a large knife, mash the garlic to a paste with 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Stir the paste into the meat, along with the lime juice, olive oil and sliced onion. Let stand at room temperature for at least 30 minutes or up to 1 1/2 hours.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Heat a large, flat griddle until very hot. Working in batches, spread the shredded beef on the griddle in a thin layer and season with salt and pepper. Cook over high heat, turning once or twice, until sizzling and crispy in spots, about 6 minutes per batch. Transfer to a platter and serve.</li>

                  <h4>Ingredients</h4>
                  <p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>6 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
                      <li>2 1/2 pounds skirt steak, cut along the grain into 6-inch pieces</li>
                      <li>3 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
                      <li>2 large white onions, halved</li>
                      <li>2 large green bell peppers, halved</li>
                      <li>5 cups water</li>
                      <li>1 bay leaf 3 garlic cloves, peeled and smashed, divided</li>
                      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
                      <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
                      <li>1/3 cup dry white wine</li>
                      <li>2 cups crushed tomatoes (canned or fresh)</li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>
                <h4>How to Make It</h4>
                <p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in an uncovered pressure cooker over medium-high. Sprinkle steak with 2 teaspoons salt. Working in batches, sear steak pieces until well browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a medium bowl. Add 1 onion half and 1 bell pepper half to pressure cooker and cook, stirring after 2 minutes, until browned in spots, about 5 minutes. Return steak to pressure cooker; add 5 cups water, bay leaf, and 1 garlic clove. Lock lid into place and set pressure to HIGH (15 pounds); bring up to pressure over high heat. When pressurized, reduce heat to medium and cook 20 minutes. Remove from heat, release pressure, and let stand until pressure is completely released</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>When pressure cooker unlocks, transfer steak to a bowl; cool 10 minutes. When cool enough to handle, shred steak by hand. (The pieces do not need to be uniform.) Return shredded meat to bowl. Pour cooking liquid through a fine wire-mesh strainer into a bowl; reserve 2 cups liquid. Discard solids and remaining liquid</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Thinly slice remaining onion and bell pepper halves. Heat remaining 1/4 cup oil in a large, high-sided skillet over medium. Add sliced onions, peppers, and remaining 2 garlic cloves to skillet. Cook, stirring often, until onions are translucent, about 10 minutes. Stir in cumin and oregano. Add wine. Bring to a simmer; add shredded steak and remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons salt. Fold to incorporate with vegetables.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Simmer until meat is warmed through, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes and 2 cups reserved cooking liquid. Bring to a simmer, stirring. Cover and reduce heat to medium-low. Gently simmer, stirring every 5 minutes, until meat is tender and liquid is thickened, about 20 minutes. If necessary, uncover and cook several minutes to thicken sauce.</li>

                    <li>Preheat the oven to 300°. Season the oxtails with salt. In a large enameled cast-iron casserole, heat the olive oil over moderately high heat.

Add the onions, tomatoes, celery, carrot and garlic and cook over moderately high heat until just starting to brown, about 15 minutes. Stir i the wine and sherry, bring to a boil and cook for 10 minutes. Return the oxtails othe casserole. Add 8 cups of water along with the bay leaf and peppercorns. Bring to a boil, then cover and transfer to the oven. Braise, stirring the oxtails a few times, until very tender, about 3 1/2 hours. Let cool, then cover and refrigerate overnight. Skim the fat from the top of the stew.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Gently reheat the stew over moderate heat. Transfer the oxtails to a large plate. Strain the sauce into a large bowl, pressing on the solids. Discard the solids. Return the sauce to the casserole and bring to a boil, then simmer for about 10 minutes, until slightly thickened. Season with salt. Return the oxtails to the sauce and simmer until warm. Transfer the oxtails and sauce to bowls, garnish with celery leaves and serve with bread. /li>

            <p>
              <ul>
                <li><em><strong>Caramel</strong></em></li>
                <li>1 cup sugar</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons light corn syrup</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons fresh orange juice
                  <br> plus 1 tablespoon finely grated orange zest</li>
                <li><em><strong>Custard</strong></em></li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups milk</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups heavy cream</li>
                <li>3 large eggs </li>
                <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
                <li>2/3 cup sugar</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon finely grated orange zest</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
                <li>Kosher salt</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
          <h4>How to Make It</h4>
          <p>
            <ol>
              <li><em><Strong>Make the caramel<strong></em><br>
                  In a small saucepan, gently stir the sugar with the corn syrup, orange juice and 2 tablespoons of water. Bring to a boil over moderate heat. Cook, without stirring, until an amber caramel forms, 6 to 8 minutes. Brush down the side of the pan with a wet pastry brush if crystals form. Remove the pan from the heat and swirl in the grated orange zest. Working quickly, pour the caramel into eight 6-ounce ramekins, tilting to coat the bottoms.</li>
                  <br>

              <li><em><strong>Make the custard</strong></em><br>
                  Preheat the oven to 350°. In a medium saucepan, combine the milk and cream and cook over moderate heat until it reaches 160°, 5 to 7 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large heatproof bowl, whisk the eggs with the egg yolks, sugar, orange zest, vanilla extract and a pinch of salt. While whisking constantly, slowly add the hot milk mixture to the eggs. Strain the custard through a fine mesh sieve set over a large heatproof measuring cup.</li>
                  <br>
                  <li>Line a roasting pan with a kitchen towel and set the   ramekins on the towel. Pour the custard into the ramekins. Add enough boiling water to the roasting pan to reach halfway up the sides of the ramekins.</li>
                  <br>
                  <li>Loosely tent the pan with foil and bake the flans for 35 to 40 minutes, until just set but still jiggly in the center. Using tongs, carefully transfer the ramekins to a rack and let the flans cool to room temperature. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or, preferably, overnight.</li>
                  <br>
                  <li>Run a thin knife around each flan. Invert a plate over each ramekin, then turn the flan out onto the plate, shaking the ramekin gently if necessary. Serve or refrigerate immediately.</li>

Discard the cinnamon sticks and the strips of orange zest. Stir in the sour cream. Serve the rice pudding warm or at room temperature, sprinkled with ground cinnamon and finely grated orange zest.</li>

                <li>2 tablespoons light brown sugar</li>
                <li>1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter, softened</li>
                <li>1 vanilla bean, split, seeds scraped</li>
                <li>1/2 large pineapple—peeled, quartered, cored and sliced 1/3 inch thick</li>
                <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
          <h4>How to Make It</h4>
          <p>
            <ol>
              <li>Preheat the oven to 350°. Butter an 8-inch round cake pan. Sprinkle the bottom with 2 tablespoons of the brown sugar.</li>
              <br>
              <li>In a large skillet, combine the remaining 3/4 cup of brown sugar with the 1/2 stick of butter and the vanilla bean and seeds and cook over moderately low heat until the butter is melted. Add the pineapple and cook over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until the pineapple is tender, about 20 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, arrange the slices in the cake pan, overlapping them if necessary. Remove the vanilla bean and pour the pan juices over the pineapple.</li>
              <br>
              <li>In a bowl, whisk 1/4 cup of the sour cream with the eggs and vanilla. In another bowl, beat the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Add the remaining stick of butter and 1/4 cup of sour cream and beat at low speed until smooth, then beat at medium speed until fluffy. Add the sour cream–egg mixture and beat again until fluffy, 2 minutes.</li>
              <br>
              <li>Spoon the batter over the pineapple and spread it evenly. Bake for about 40 minutes, until the cake is deep golden. Let cool for 5 minutes on a rack. Run a knife around the edge of the cake, invert it onto a plate and remove the pan. Replace any pineapple that may have stuck to the pan. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>

            <ol>
              <li>In a large skillet, melt the butter in the olive oil. Add the chicken, ham, nutmeg and a large pinch each of salt and pepper. Cook over moderate heat, stirring, for 3 minutes.

          <h3>Edilia Puig</h3>
          <p>Born and raised in Cuba, Edilia Puig learned how to cook traditional Cuban Cuisine like most woman did on the island. When the time came for her family to escape their homeland, my grandmother tried to make the trasition as smooth as possible for her little children.
            <br>
            <br>
           To try to keep some sense of normalcy in their lives, and because it was all she knew, my grandmother cooked her favorite recipes as often as she could. Not only did she share her meals and recipes with the rest of her community, but she also passed them down to my mother, who has since passed tham down to me. Cooking and having meals together hold a special power and magic that keep families and memories together in a strong bond, a bond that goes beyond time and distance. <br>
           <br>
            And now I share some of her favorite recipes with you, the way she taught me.</p>
